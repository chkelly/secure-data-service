Feature: <US63> In order to manage schools
    As a client application using SLI
    I want to have create, read, update, and delete functionality for a school.

#Background probably eliminates for most of the Given clauses in the scenarios - revisit
Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
	#Given the dummy data is loaded
	Given I am logged in using "jimi" "jimi"
	Given I have access to all schools

#### Happy Path 
Scenario: Create a new school JSON
    Given format "application/json"
       And the short name is "SCTS"
	  And the full name is "School Crud Test School"
	  And the website is "www.scts.edu"
    When I navigate to POST "/schools/" 
    #should be 201....get this fixed
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
       And I should receive a ID for the newly created school

	  
Scenario: Read a school by id
    Given format "application/json"
    When I GET the newly created school by id
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
       And I should see the school "School Crud Test School"
       And I should see a website of "www.scts.edu"

Scenario: Update an existing school
    Given format "application/json"
      And the website is "www.scts.com"
    When I PUT/update the newly created school's website'
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
     When  I GET the newly created school by id
 	 And I should see a website of "www.scts.com"
 	 
Scenario: Delete an existing school
    Given format "application/json"
    When I DELETE the newly created school
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
     When I GET the newly created school by id
     Then I should receive a return code of 404
        
#### XML version
Scenario: Create a new school XML
    Given format "application/xml"
       And the short name is "SCTSX"
	  And the full name is "School Crud Test School XML"
	  And the website is "www.sctsx.edu"
    When I navigate to POST "/schools/" 
    #should be 201....fix this in API
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
       And I should receive a ID for the newly created school
       
Scenario: Delete an existing school XML
    #bug below....should allow that content type
    #Given format "application/xml"
    When I DELETE the newly created school
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
     When I GET the newly created school by id
     Then I should receive a return code of 404
	  
### Error handling
